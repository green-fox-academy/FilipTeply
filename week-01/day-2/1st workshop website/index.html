                    <h3>Bit</h3>
                    <p>A bit (short for binary digit) is the smallest unit of data in a computer. A bit has a single binary value, either 0 or 1.The smallest element of information (0/1) in a computer. 			</p>
                    
                    <h3>Byte</h3>
                    <p>8 bits			</p>

                    <h3>Character Code (ASCII)</h3>
                    <p>American Standard Code for Information Interchange, 1963, allows interoperativity, 7 bit code (128 values) 			<p/>
                    

                    <h3>CPU</h3>
                    <p>Central Processing Unit, the CPU is the brains of the computer where most calculations take place.			<p/>
                    

                    <h3>Control Unit</h3>
                    <p>CU is a component of a CPU. It directs the operation of the processor. It tells the computer's memory, arithmetic&logic unit and input and output devices how to respond to the instructions that have been sent to the processor.			</p>
                    
                    <h3>ALU</h3>

                    <h3>Instruction Set</h3>

                    <h3>Clock</h3>
                    <p>clock speed refers to the number of pulses per second generated by an oscillator that sets the tempo for the processor. Clock speed is usually measured in MHz (megahertz, or millions of pulses per second) or GHz (gigahertz, or billions of pulses per second). Today's personal computers run at a clock speed in the hundreds of megahertz and some exceed one gigahertz. The clock speed is determined by a quartz-crystal circuit, similar to those used in radio communications equipment.Tacting frequency</p>		
                   
                    <h3>RAM</h3> 
                    <p>Random Access Memory</p>


                    
        
                        <p>It is an idealized or physical device implementing a Boolean function; that is, it performs a logical operation on one or more binary inputs and produces a single binary output.

                        It stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange. Computers can only understand numbers, so it is the numerical representation of a character such as 'a' or '@' or an action of some sort.
                        
                        It is a form of computer data storage which stores frequently used program instructions to increase the general speed of a system. It can be randomly accessed. Data items to be read or written in almost the same amount of time irrespective of the physical location of data inside the memory.
                        
                        A formal language that specifies a set of instructions that can be used to produce various kinds of output. They generally consist of instructions for a computer and can be used to create programs that implement specific algorithms.
                        
                        A hierarchical decentralized naming system for computers, services, or other resources connected to the Internet or a private network. It associates various information with domain names assigned to each of the participating entities.
                        
                        An application protocol for distributed, collaborative, and hypermedia information systems. It is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web. It is the standard protocol to exchange or transfer hypertext.</p>
